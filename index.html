                        <p>Francis Bacon, (born October 28, 1909, Dublin, Ireland—died April 28, 1992, Madrid, Spain), Irish artist and one of the most unique, engaging figurative painters to emerge during the post-war period. Self-taught as an artist, he drifted in Berlin and Paris before settling in London in 1928, after which he worked as an interior decorator. He had also begun painting, though he did so without recognition until 1945, at which time the original and powerful style displayed in such works as Three Studies for Figures at the Base of a Crucifixion (1944) won him almost instant recognition. Many of Bacon’s early paintings are based on images by other artists, which he distorts for his own expressive purposes. Many of them depict isolated figures, often framed by geometric constructions, and rendered in smeared, daring colours. He was admired for his skill in using oils, whose fluidity and mysteries he exploits to express strong emotions.</p>
